# Summary
We built a game about using a spacecraft that shoots lasers to push orbital scrap to change it's orbit into a crashing course or making it leave the earth's gravity field The idea of pushing scrap comes from the phenomenon of ablating and photonic push
How We Addressed This Challenge

It is a game in which to score you have to remove space scrap from earth's orbit, by slowing it down and burning it on earth's atmosphere or speeding it up to make it leave earth's gravitational field using a laser on space to push them around.

# How We Developed This Project

The game is coded on javascript, using Phaser 3.

It was constructed sharing files over github and information over discord.

The images were taken from nasa's page and all icons were drawn on gimp

The biggest problem was simulating gravity and forces without making the game too expensive on memory

The second problem we couldn't find a solution was when, in the game, trash crashed against crash it should generate more particles but each time we made it happen it would make the game explode.

Our achievements were learning how to program on javascript on 2 days and distant teamworking

# How We Used Space Agency Data in This Project

We used it to understand and know how space debris works and what problems it brings, and the size of the space scrap the ISS can withstand.

# Project Demo

This will run the game on page, beware of long loading time after pressing "play"
